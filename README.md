Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    The program runs in an infinite while True loop.

    It asks the user to enter a number.

    If the number is divisible by 2 (% 2 == 0), it prints that it is even.

    Otherwise, it prints that it is odd.

    This repeats again and again until you stop the program manually.
    

Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50

    Inside the loop, a variable sum is set to 0.

    A for loop runs from 1 to 50.

    Each number is added to sum.

    After the loop finishes, it prints the total sum (1275)
